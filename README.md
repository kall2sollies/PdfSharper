## Pdf Sharper

This project is a PDF Slicer.

It will take CSV files as index reference, and will output slices given the
index and ranges provided.

## Why

As a jazz musicien, I own several copies of score as big PDF files 
(like hundreds of pages) and need to be able to find one song at one specific
page, and open it as fast as it can be. Therefore I need to slice my PDFs
given an index file, and ouput hundreds of tiny files with a naming template.
